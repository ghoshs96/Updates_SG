                    <p>Category: Analysis, Results</p>
                    <p>
                        Today was a significant day! After struggling with the outlier detection for the past week, I finally implemented the robust statistical method discussed in the recent paper by Dr. Smith. The initial results are promising, showing a clearer distribution of my experimental data. This should greatly improve the accuracy of the subsequent modeling phase.

                    <p>Category: Literature, Planning</p>
                    <p>
                        Spent the day diving deeper into the literature on [specific sub-topic]. Found three highly relevant papers that provide new perspectives on my methodology. Also, outlined the plan for the next two weeks, focusing on completing the data cleaning and starting the initial model training.
